# Algorithm Programs

# Write static functions to return all permutations of a String using iterative method and Recursion method.
* Check if the arrays returned by two string functions are equal.

# Binary Search the Word from Word List
* Desc -> 
* Read in a list of words from File.
*  Then prompt the user to enter a word to search the list.
*   The program reports if the search word is found in the list.
* I/P -> read in the list words comma separated from a File and then enter the word to be searched
* Logic -> Use Arrays to sort the word list and then do the binary search
* O/P -> Print the result if the word is found or not

# Insertion Sort
* Desc -> 
* Reads in strings and prints them in sorted order using insertion sort.
* I/P -> read in the list words
* Logic -> Use Insertion Sort to sort the words in the String array
* O/P -> Print the Sorted List

# Bubble Sort
* Desc -> 
* Reads in integers prints them in sorted order using Bubble Sort
* I/P -> read in the list ints
* O/P -> Print the Sorted List

# Merge Sort - Write a program to do Merge Sort of list of Strings.
* Logic -> To Merge Sort an array, we divide it into two halves, sort the two halves
* independently, and then merge the results to sort the full array. 

# 6. An Anagram Detection Example
* Desc -> 
* One string is an anagram of another if the second is simply a
* rearrangement of the first. For example, 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams...
* I/P -> Take 2 Strings as Input such abcd and dcba and Check for Anagrams
* O/P -> The Two Strings are Anagram or not....

# Take a range of 0 - 1000 Numbers and find the Prime numbers in that range.

# Extend the above program to find the prime numbers that are Anagram and Palindrome

# Rewrite Use Generics for Search and Sort Algorithms

# Question to find your number
* Desc -> 
* takes a command-line argument N, asks you to think of a number 
  between 0 and N-1, where N = 2^n, and always guesses the answer with n questions.
* I/P -> the Number N and then recursively ask true/false if the number is between a high and low value
* Logic -> Use Binary Search to find the number
* O/P -> Print the intermediary number and the final answer

# You have a long list of tasks that you need to do today. 
* To accomplish task you need M minutes, and the deadline for this task is D . 
* You need not complete a task at a stretch.
*  You can complete a part of it, switch to another task, and then switch back.You've
* realized that it might not be possible to complete all the tasks by their deadline. 
* So you decide to do them in such a manner that the maximum amount by which a task's
* completion time overshoots its deadline is minimized.
* Input Format - The first line contains the number of tasks, . 
* Each of the next lines contains two integers,D and M .
* Output Format - Output T lines. The ith line contains the value of the maximum
* amount by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline, 
* when the first tasks on your list are scheduled optimally.

# Customize Message Demonstration using String Function and RegEx
* Desc -> 
* Read in the following message: Hello <<name>>, 
* We have your full name as <<full name>> in our system. 
*  your contact number is 91-xxxxxxxxxx.
* Please,let us know in case of any clarification Thank you BridgeLabz 01/01/2016.
* Use Regex to replace name, full name, Mobile#, and Date with proper value.
* I/P -> read in the Message
* Logic -> Use Regex to do the following
* Replace <<name>> by first name of the user ( assume you are the user)
* replace <<full name>> by user full name.
* replace any occurance of mobile number that should be in format 91-xxxxxxxxxx by your contact number.
* replace any date in the format XX/XX/XXXX by current date.
* O/P -> Print the Modified Message.
